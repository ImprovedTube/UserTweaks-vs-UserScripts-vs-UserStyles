## UserTweaks  `( vs UserScripts vs UserStyles )`

Herewith  we claim a new word:   "UserTweaks" !  

<img width="527" alt="usertweaks" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25022245/115540770-a7485500-a29e-11eb-9a98-c54a7a3823fb.png">

"improve (a mechanism or system) by making fine adjustments to it."

**Idea:** Crowd-Sourcing CSS Tweaks.  The web as a CSS Collaboration Wiki. 
- vs. UserScripts: Require security review.    Same as browser extensions. (Might be a source.)
- vs. UserStyles(.org): Currently mostly themes / playful.  (Might be a source.)

## Scheme, Rule of the game: 
- Everybody gets every tweak, as long as it is voted >80% "Yes" or "Yes, global".  Every user is asked twice. Disabling too soon within voting period overwrites your vote to "No"
  - This will motivate unexpected help & wonderful creativitiy: 
     - Deleting useless things 
     - Enlarging tiny inputs 
     - Correcting fake news in place
     - 'Online-StreetArt'
