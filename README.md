## UserTweaks  
_vs UserScripts vs UserStyles_

Herewith I claim a new word:   "**UserTweaks**" !  <br> to tweak: _"improve (a mechanism or system) by making fine adjustments to it."_ <br>

**Idea:** Crowd-Sourcing CSS Tweaks. The web as a CSS Collaboration Wiki. 
- vs. UserScripts: Require security review.    Same as browser extensions. (Might be a source.)
- vs. UserStyles(.org): Currently mostly themes / playful.  (Might be a source.)

## Scheme, Rule of the game: 
- Everybody gets every tweak, as long as it is voted in consensus >80% "Yes" or "Yes, global".  Every user can be asked later/twice. Disabling a tweak might change your vote to "No", to support a mildly inclusive/tolerant atmosphere
   - This will motivate unexpected help & wonderful creativitiy: 
     - Deleting useless things 
     - Enlarging tiny inputs 
     - Correcting fake news in place
     - 'Online-StreetArt'
