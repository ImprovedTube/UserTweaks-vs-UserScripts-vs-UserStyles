## "CollectiveTweaks"  -  _`Crowdsource (y)our view`_  

 - A new word. (Easier than "userScripts", more relevant/functional than "userStyles", but especially a collective crowd effort) <br> (to tweak: _"improve (a mechanism or system) by making **fine** adjustments to it."_) <br>

## **Idea:**  
### Crowd-Sourcing universal CSS Tweaks to refine, renew, reimagine the web.  <br> - One-fit-all. The web as a CSS(/js)-collaboration / wiki  

- **Mandate:** Tweaks for everybody.   -  If we can achieve that, can we also make the community of volunteers grow/prosper from it? 
Or must we tolerate, if our work will be implemented by the originals, (after we prove it right, yet) without giving us credit?

- **Scheme / "Rule of the game":**  Everybody runs every tweak out of a pool/catalogue, that is was voted up, near consensus by the community:  >80%  "Yes".  Every user can be asked again later. (Disabling a tweak will also automatically change your vote to "No")  (no login/key required if no/little incentive in manipulation.)
    - This will motivate thoughtfulness, unexpected help, wonderful creativitiy: 
        - Deleting useless things 
        - Enlarging tiny inputs
        - Correcting fake news in place.
        - 'Online-StreetArt'
        - ...
   - + "Holy-Grail of Ideas": Could any tweak be applied both for everybody AND on wide URL-range, such as *.org|edu|gov ((=not just one website)  

**2.** There can be specific rule sets, as in Adblockers.  For example one called "BrandMeNot" ("Logo-Hater") (removing commercial logos) (Except those that >80% of users think should not be removed/are relevant content, very social or very small companies). (This/such rule-set might not be wanted by more than 80% of people, yet opt-in, with internal votings)

-------------

   - In other words:
     -   Like UserScripts & UserStyles but pragmatic, with voting resulting in collectively running  things & little effort per person
         - [UserScripts](https://greasyfork.org) (Often require some review, same as browser extensions. ) 
         - [UserStyles.org](https://userstyles.org) (Currently mostly themes/playful. Easy adjustability tho already) 
     - Not only for devs [css-peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk), [user js&css](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld), [Live css,less,sass:octocat:](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor) 
     - Nor "Remix the web"-niche for style-nerds [chrome.google/webstore/amino-live-css](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amino-live-css-editor/pbcpfbcibpcbfbmddogfhcijfpboeaaf)

<b>1.</b> The google analytics filter field is very small since ages. It also is very far on the right. 
<br><br><br> Lets make it just a little better: <code> .ID-filterBox { width:190px !important;  font-size: 14px !important;  height: 21px !important;} </code><br>
<br><br><br><b>2.</b> Youtube's sidebar is very bold and contrasty, compared to actuall videos. Lets counter balance that by just 12% transparency: <code> #secondary {opacity:0.88} </code><br> <br> <b>3.</b> The following two github standard labels can be boring / unnecessary to watch, so lets make them just a bit less visible: <br>
<code> a[data-name^='help wanted'], a[data-name^='good first issue'] {opacity: 0.80; transform:scale(0.96);} </code>
