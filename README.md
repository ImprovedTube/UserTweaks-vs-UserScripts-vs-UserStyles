## "CollectiveTweaks"  -  _`Crowdsource (y)our view`_    

/ 'Crowd Fixes' / UserTweaks? - A new word? Easier than "userScripts"; universally relevant/functional unlike "userStyles", but especially a collective crowd effort <br> (to tweak: _"improve (a mechanism or system) by making **fine** adjustments to it."_) <br>

## **Idea:**  
### Crowd-Sourcing universal CSS Tweaks to refine, renew, reimagine the web.  <br> - One-fit-all. The web as a CSS(/js)-collaboration / wiki  

- **Mandate:** Tweaks for everybody.   (If we can achieve the best, can we also make the community of volunteers grow/prosper from it? 
Or must we tolerate, if our work will be implemented by the originals, after we prove it right, without giving us credit?)

- **Scheme / "Rules of the game":**  Everybody runs every tweak out of a pool/catalogue, that is was voted up, democratically or near consensus by the community, i.e.  >70%  "Yes", while  quickly disabling a tweak could also inevitably change one's vote to "No". Collecting at least 100 votes for each, by users/volunteers & revisors/developers. ( * Wisdom Of The Crowd:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOucwX7Z1HU) (User IDs could be random, data could be public, on a central server or in a blockchain / L2 blockchain)
    - This will motivate thoughtfulness, unexpected help, wonderful creativitiy: 
        - Deleting useless things 
        - Enlarging tiny inputs
        - Web-street art.
        - Correcting fake news in place.
        - ...
   - (Most rules will be per domain. Could any tweak be applied both for everybody AND on wide URL-range, such as *.org|edu|gov. "Holy-Grail"?)
   - **2.** There can be specific rule sets, as in Adblockers.  For example one called "Brand-Me-Not" or "Logo-Hater", removing commercial logos, (Except those that >70% of users think should not be removed/are relevant content, very social or very small companies). (This/such rule-set as a whole in turn might not be wanted by more than 80% of people, so that it will be at risk of becoming optional opt-in. But could keep the same votings per tweak within at the general ones.)

   - In other words:
     -   Similar: UserScripts & UserStyles but pragmatic, with voting resulting in collectively running  things & little effort per person
         - [UserScripts](https://greasyfork.org) (Often require some review, same as browser extensions. ) 
         - [UserStyles.org](https://userstyles.org) (Currently mostly themes/playful. Easy adjustability tho already) 
     - Not only for devs [css-peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk), [user js&css](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld), [Live css,less,sass:octocat:](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor)

<b>1.</b> The google analytics filter field is very small since ages. It also is very far on the right. 
<br><br><br> Lets make it just a little better: <code> .ID-filterBox { width:190px !important;  font-size: 14px !important;  height: 21px !important;} </code><br>
<br><br><br><b>2.</b> Youtube's sidebar is very bold and contrasty, compared to actuall videos. Lets counter balance that by just 12% transparency: <code> #secondary {opacity:0.88} </code><br> <br> <b>3.</b> The following two github standard labels can be boring / unnecessary to watch, so lets make them just a bit less visible: <br>
<code> a[data-name^='help wanted'], a[data-name^='good first issue'] {opacity: 0.80; transform:scale(0.96);} </code>
