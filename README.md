# UserTweaks  ( vs UserScripts vs UserStyles )

Herewith we claim a new word:  "UserTweaks" !  (April 21 2021)

Idea: Crowd-Sourcing CSS Tweaks.  The web as a CSS Collaboration Wiki. 
- vs. UserScripts: requires security review)  
- vs. UserStyles(.org) is currently mostly Themes / playful.  

# Scheme / Rules of the game: 
- Everybody gets every tweak, as long as it is voted >80% "Yes" or "Yes global".  Every user is asked twice 
- Disabling too soon within voting period overwrites vote to "No"

This will motivate unexpected help & wonderful creativitiy: 

-Deleting useless things 

-enlarging tiny inputs 

-correcting fake news in place
